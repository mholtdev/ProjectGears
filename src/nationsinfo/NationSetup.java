/* -Create a random name generator for the name of the nation, ruler's name, people's name, currency name,etc.
 * -Create values and basic traits for the nations goals, provide a initial currency value, figure out how to balance currency values between each other
 * -Set up that The nations won't overpower the player right at the start of the game, and that if the player doesn't do anything, the world still simualates around him
